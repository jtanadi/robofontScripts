### Etch-A-Sketch
Script to help with sketching

**Needs [DrawBot module](https://github.com/typemytype/drawBotRoboFontExtension) installed, but doesn't need to be run in DrawBot Extension.**

- Custom font name when no font is open
- Open font can be assigned as refrence in title block (e.g. when sketching different weights, etc.)
- Adjustable x-height (in inches)
- Distribution and number of sketch lines influenced by x-height
- Ascender & descender guides: match current font metrics or user-defined when no font is open
- [Non-photo blue lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-photo_blue) (for scanning — but not sure how useful
- Grayed-out letters (to simulate trace paper)

Type some glyphs, print a sheet (or save a PDF), and sketch:

Sketch a new font using current font as reference:

If no font is open, the script will return a blank sketch sheet with guide lines:
